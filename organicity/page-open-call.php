                        <h3>Become an Experimenter in OrganiCity</h3>
                        <p>OrganiCity offers a new paradigm to European digital city making.The project seeks to develop a strong foundation for future sustainable cities through co-creation by a wide range of stakeholders. Globally, Europe is a champion of sustainable, inclusive and open societies. The digital age enables us to push this position further and to rethink the way we create cities and facilitate living by integrating many complex systems.</p>
                        <p>OrganiCity combines top-down planning and operations with flexible bottom-up initiatives where citizen involvement is key. By focusing on the city as a socio-technical whole, OrganiCity brings software, hardware and associated human processes flexibly together into a new living city that is replicable, scalable as well as socially, environmentally and economically sustainable.</p>

                        <h3>Objectives of the First Open Call January 2016</h3>
                        <p>As civic participation and co­-creation are considered by the project as an equally important component of future cities as technology solutions, €1.8m, one quarter of the entire budget for the OrganiCity project, is reserved directly for citizen-­driven experiments. This, the first of two open calls, intends to initiate experimentation on the facility which is under development and one third of the Open Call budget is released. This means that €600.000 are available across Aarhus (DK), London (UK) and Santander (ES) allowing up to €200.000 per cluster on various experiments.</p>
                        <p>OrganiCity is seeking innovative experiment proposals that explore the potential of the OrganiCity facility to be a greenhouse for European growth and digital urban systems development. It is the goal of this open goal to “kickstart” a new generation of city makers who will utilise, evaluate and contribute to the facility during experimentation and beyond.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Many inhabitants in the inner city live in small apartments and use the city as a second living room. The citizens emphasizes the importance of life around them in the city, but at the same time they underline the importance of privacy in the public sphere.</li>
                            <li>The smaller squares and marketplaces around the city should be taken into use and thereby create more life.</li>
